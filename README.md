# SnowPALM
Snow Physics and Lidar Mapping Model

SnowPALM is a high temporal (1 hour) and spatial (1 meter) resolution mass and energy balance snowpack model that is designed to reproduce snowpack distributions in forested environments. The model accounts for topographic and vegetation influences on radiation, interception, and the turbulent exchanges of mass and energy at the snow surface. 

It is described in Broxton et al., 2015 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eco.1565)
